# BH-Invest
As part of my collaboration with BH Invest, I developed an interactive Power BI dashboard that provides a comprehensive overview of the Tunis Stock Exchange as of May 2025.

The project includes:
* Analysis of market capitalization, foreign participation, and traded volumes.
* Visualization of TUNINDEX and sectoral indices performance.
* Monitoring of BH Group listed companies (BH Bank, BH Assurance, BH Leasing).
* Integration of macroeconomic indicators such as interest rates, inflation, and exchange rates.
* A ranking of stock performance (gainers and losers) up to May 31, 2025.

This project highlights my ability to transform financial data into actionable insights using Power BI, with a focus on clarity, interactivity, and decision-making support.
